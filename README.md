## üìã Problem Statement

### Title
**"Decoding Development: A Data-Driven Dashboard for India Growth Metrics"**

### Background
Every nation's progress depends not on one factor but on a blend of economic, social, and environmental indicators. Understanding this data holistically can drive better policy-making, awareness, and decision-making.

### Objective
Design and develop an interactive data dashboard or application that visualizes and analyzes multiple national growth metrics for various cities. The platform should allow users to explore, compare, and interpret how different cities are performing across a comprehensive set of development indicators.
